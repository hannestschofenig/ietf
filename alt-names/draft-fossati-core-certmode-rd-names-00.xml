      <t>This memo describes the use of Resource Directory names in CoAP Certificate Mode DTLS for the purpose of verifying the identity of a server by a client endpoint.</t>

    <section title="Terminology and Requirements Language">
      <t>This specification requires the reader to be familiar with the terminology used in documents produced by the CoRE, TLS, and PKIX working groups.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
    </section>  <!-- Terminology and Requirements Language -->

    <section title="Motivation and Scope">
      <t>According to Section 9.1.3.3 of <xref target="RFC7252" />, a client, when presented with a certificate carrying the identity of the server in the SubjectAltName (SAN), must check that the authority of the requested URI matches at least one of the authority names of any CoAP URI found in a field of URI type in the SAN set.</t>

      <t>According to Section 4.2.1.6 of <xref target="RFC5280" /> an URI that includes an authority - such as a 'coaps' URI - needs to include a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or an IP literal as its host part.</t>

      <t>The combination of the two requirements above, together with text in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC6066" /> which only allows FQDN hostname of the server in the ServerName field, basically binds Certificate Mode DTLS to either DNS, or static host tables containing FQDN's mappings, or some other system for lookup of registered names which is able to fully mimic the DNS naming scheme.</t>

      <t>Because DNS is not mandatory to implement in CoAP networks, and static configuration is not generally a viable option, there is a need to define some kind of stable, non-DNS, identifier that can be used for 'coaps' URIs in Certificate Mode DTLS as a fall-back in case DNS is not deployed, or not understood by CoAP endpoints.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this memo is to describe syntax and rules for using Resource Directory endpoint names (and domains) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory" /> as an alternative to DNS names in the above said context.</t>

      <t>This memo contains updates to <xref target="RFC7252" />, <xref target="RFC6066" />, and <xref target="RFC5280" />.</t>
    </section>  <!-- Motivation -->

    <section title="Resource Directory Names and Domains">
      <t>In CoAP networks, a Resource Directory (RD) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory" /> is an entity that acts as a centralised store where protocol endpoints can register and lookup links to resources that are made available in the network.  The RD defines the concept of an "endpoint name" which identifies a given Endpoint (i.e. web server) within a given "domain".  Under the assumption of its uniqueness, an endpoint name/domain can be used as a stable host component for CoAP authorities.</t>
      <section title="Uniqueness Guarantee">
        <t>An endpoint name is guaranteed to be unique within the associated domain.  If the domain is elided during registration, the RD should assure its uniqueness within an implicit default domain.</t> 
        <!--
        <cref>Check with RD authors: allow an empty default domain?  In which case, modify the ABNF to allow authorities like "node2.:12345"</cref>.
        -->
      </section>
      <section title="Authority Format" anchor="RD-format">
        <section title="Requirements">
        <t>The syntax for RD name authorities has been designed to satisfy the following requirements:
          <list style="hanging" hangIndent="8">
            <t hangText="REQ#1:">full compatibility with URI reg-name syntax;</t>
            <t hangText="REQ#2:">support identifiers from different and independently administered sources (e.g. those defined in OMA spec, EUI-64 <xref target="EUI-64"/>, etc.);</t>
            <t hangText="REQ#3:">allow for an optional "domain" under which a given name exists (for compatibility with current RD spec).</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Syntax">
          <t>The following ABNF reuses 'port' from <xref target="RFC3986" />; ALPHA and DIGIT from <xref target="RFC5234" />.</t>
          <figure>
            <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[

  RD-ns = ALPHA *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")  ; the name-space
  RD-name = 1*RD-char
  RD-domain = 1*63RD-char
  RD-authority = [ RD-ns "+" ] RD-name [ "." RD-domain ] [ ":" port ]
            ]]></artwork>
          </figure>
          <t>Note that RD-char is the set of chars allowed in reg-name (REQ#1) from which the two following characters have been removed:
            <list style="symbols"> 
              <t>the dot ("."), which is used to introduce the domain component (REQ#3);</t>
              <t>the plus ("+"), which is used to encode namespace information along with the name in an unambiguous way (REQ#2).</t>
            </list>   
          </t>
          <t>If RD-ns is present, then the length of RD-ns and RD-name MUST be less then 63 chars.</t>
          <t>Percent encoding MUST NOT be used if not needed, i.e. it can be used only to encode non otherwise allowed chars.</t>

        <section title="Uri-Host and Uri-Port Considerations" anchor="Implicit-Option-Values">
          <t>When RD-authority is used in a 'coaps' URI, its value is the same as the ServerName.name included (and successfully validated) by the client in the associated DTLS handshake (see <xref target="RD-SNI" />).</t>
          <t>Hence, there is no need to include explicit Uri-Host and Uri-Port Options in requests associated to the same security context <cref>This updates Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of [RFC7252]</cref>.</t>
          <t>If any of Uri-Host or Uri-Port is included in the request, then its value MUST match the corresponding value set in the established security context.</t>
